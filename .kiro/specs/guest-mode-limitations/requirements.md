# Guest Mode Limitations - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Math Tutor should encourage user registration by implementing smart limitations for guest users. After using key features a limited number of times, guest users should be prompted to create an account to continue using the platform. This approach balances user experience (allowing exploration) with business goals (encouraging registration).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Guest Usage Tracking

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to track guest user interactions with key features, so that I can prompt them to register at the right moment without being too aggressive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guest user accesses the Problem Solver THEN the system SHALL increment a usage counter
2. WHEN a guest user accesses the Quiz feature THEN the system SHALL increment a usage counter  
3. WHEN a guest user accesses the Progress Dashboard THEN the system SHALL increment a usage counter
4. WHEN usage counters are incremented THEN they SHALL be stored in localStorage for persistence
5. WHEN a user registers or logs in THEN all usage counters SHALL be reset

### Requirement 2: Smart Registration Prompts

**User Story:** As a guest user, I want to be able to explore the platform freely for a few interactions, but then be encouraged to create an account to continue using advanced features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guest user uses Problem Solver more than 2 times THEN the system SHALL show a registration prompt
2. WHEN a guest user uses Quiz feature more than 2 times THEN the system SHALL show a registration prompt
3. WHEN a guest user uses Progress Dashboard more than 1 time THEN the system SHALL show a registration prompt
4. WHEN showing registration prompts THEN the system SHALL explain the benefits of creating an account
5. WHEN a user dismisses a prompt THEN they SHALL still be able to use the feature but see the prompt again on next usage

### Requirement 3: Registration Prompt UI

**User Story:** As a guest user, I want registration prompts to be helpful and non-intrusive, so that I understand the value of creating an account without feeling forced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a registration prompt appears THEN it SHALL be displayed as a modal dialog
2. WHEN showing the prompt THEN it SHALL include "Sign Up" and "Sign In" buttons
3. WHEN showing the prompt THEN it SHALL include a "Continue as Guest" option
4. WHEN showing the prompt THEN it SHALL highlight specific benefits of registration
5. WHEN a user clicks "Continue as Guest" THEN they SHALL be able to use the feature normally

### Requirement 4: Feature-Specific Benefits

**User Story:** As a guest user, I want to understand what specific benefits I'll get by registering, so that I can make an informed decision about creating an account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompting from Problem Solver THEN the system SHALL highlight "Save your problem history" and "Get personalized hints"
2. WHEN prompting from Quiz feature THEN the system SHALL highlight "Track your progress" and "Get adaptive difficulty"
3. WHEN prompting from Progress Dashboard THEN the system SHALL highlight "Detailed analytics" and "Learning recommendations"
4. WHEN showing any prompt THEN it SHALL mention "Unlimited access to all features"
5. WHEN showing any prompt THEN it SHALL be contextual to the current feature being used

### Requirement 5: Graceful Degradation

**User Story:** As a guest user, I want to still be able to use basic features even after hitting limits, so that I don't feel completely blocked from the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a guest user continues past limits THEN core functionality SHALL still work
2. WHEN a guest user continues past limits THEN they SHALL see periodic reminders about registration benefits
3. WHEN a guest user continues past limits THEN some advanced features MAY be disabled or limited
4. WHEN showing limitations THEN the system SHALL clearly explain what's available vs. what requires registration
5. WHEN a user eventually registers THEN all limitations SHALL be immediately removed
