# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds forgot password functionality to the AI Math Tutor application, allowing users to securely reset their passwords when they cannot remember them. The system will provide a secure, time-limited password reset process via email verification to maintain account security while providing a smooth user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has forgotten my password, I want to request a password reset via email, so that I can regain access to my account without contacting support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" on the login page THEN the system SHALL display a password reset request form
2. WHEN a user enters their email address in the reset form THEN the system SHALL validate the email format
3. WHEN a user submits a valid email address THEN the system SHALL send a password reset email if the email exists in the system
4. WHEN a user submits an email that doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display the same success message to prevent email enumeration attacks
5. WHEN the system sends a reset email THEN it SHALL include a secure, time-limited reset token valid for 1 hour

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who received a password reset email, I want to click a secure link to reset my password, so that I can create a new password and regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the reset link in their email THEN the system SHALL validate the reset token
2. WHEN the reset token is valid and not expired THEN the system SHALL display a new password form
3. WHEN the reset token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL display an error message and redirect to the forgot password page
4. WHEN a user enters a new password THEN the system SHALL validate password strength requirements
5. WHEN a user submits a valid new password THEN the system SHALL update their password and invalidate the reset token
6. WHEN the password is successfully reset THEN the system SHALL revoke all existing user sessions for security

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want password reset tokens to be secure and time-limited, so that the system maintains security standards and prevents unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a reset token is generated THEN it SHALL be cryptographically secure and unpredictable
2. WHEN a reset token is created THEN it SHALL expire after 1 hour
3. WHEN a reset token is used successfully THEN it SHALL be immediately invalidated
4. WHEN a user requests multiple password resets THEN only the most recent token SHALL be valid
5. WHEN the system stores reset tokens THEN they SHALL be hashed in the database for security

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback during the password reset process, so that I understand what steps to take and any errors that occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a reset request THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message regardless of whether the email exists
2. WHEN a user clicks an expired reset link THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with option to request a new reset
3. WHEN a user enters an invalid new password THEN the system SHALL display specific validation errors
4. WHEN a password reset is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message and redirect to login
5. WHEN there are system errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages without exposing technical details
